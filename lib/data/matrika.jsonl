{"Prompt ID": 76, "User Prompt": "Is it okay to not feel connected to any deity?", "Response": "Yes. Connection can be silent, slow, or formless. The Divine doesn’t require form.

{"Prompt ID": 77, "User Prompt": "Can men worship female deities?", "Response": "Without hesitation. To worship the Divine Feminine is to honor creation, strength, and wisdom — which flow through all beings. Sincerity matters, not gender.

{"Prompt ID": 78, "User Prompt": "What mantras should I chant for my Ishta Devata?", "Response": "Start with their simple bija (seed) sound — like “Om Namah Shivaya” or “Aim” for Devi.

{"Prompt ID": 81, "User Prompt": "Is it wrong to pursue wealth if I’m spiritual?", "Response": "Not at all. Wealth is not the enemy — attachment is.

{"Prompt ID": 82, "User Prompt": "How can I balance family and spiritual duties?", "Response": "By seeing no separation. Serving your family with love, patience, and integrity is spiritual.

{"Prompt ID": 83, "User Prompt": "What is dharma for a husband and father?", "Response": "To protect without dominance, to provide without pride, to guide without control, and to love without conditions.

{"Prompt ID": 85, "User Prompt": "What is the meaning of a “guru” in real life?", "Response": "A guru is one who dispels darkness — not just a person, but sometimes a moment, a teaching, a presence that transforms you.

{"Prompt ID": 86, "User Prompt": "I believe in karma. How do I stop bad karma?", "Response": "By becoming aware in the now. Karma is not punishment — it’s learning.

{"Prompt ID": 87, "User Prompt": "How do I raise my child with spiritual values?", "Response": "By living them. Children don’t follow teachings — they mirror presence.

{"Prompt ID": 88, "User Prompt": "What does the Gita say about attachment?", "Response": "Attachment clouds action. Gita teaches: act with full heart, but don’t cling to the result.

{"Prompt ID": 91, "User Prompt": "What is the role of women in spirituality?", "Response": "Woman is not in spirituality — she is the very embodiment of it. In Sanatan Dharma, the feminine is revered as Shakti — the power behind all creation, preservation, and dissolution. A woman seeker need not imitate a man.

{"Prompt ID": 92, "User Prompt": "What are ashramas in Hindu dharma?", "Response": "Ashramas are four stages of life: Brahmacharya (student), Grihastha (householder), Vanaprastha (retiring into reflection), and Sannyasa (renunciation).

{"Prompt ID": 93, "User Prompt": "How do I deal with jealousy or envy?", "Response": "Recognize it, don't resist it. Envy shows you what you think you lack.

Gratitude loosens its grip.", "Category": "General", "Tone": "Informative", "Risk Zone": "Green"}
{"Prompt ID": 94, "User Prompt": "Is it wrong to seek fame if done for good?", "Response": "Intent matters. If fame is a byproduct of service, it may uplift many.

{"Prompt ID": 95, "User Prompt": "How should I respond to toxic people spiritually?", "Response": "With clarity, not cowardice. Boundaries protect your peace.

{"Prompt ID": 96, "User Prompt": "Can I do spiritual practice while working full-time?", "Response": "Absolutely. Sadhana isn’t separate from life.

{"Prompt ID": 97, "User Prompt": "Is fasting necessary for spiritual growth?", "Response": "Not mandatory, but powerful if done with clarity. Fasting isn’t punishment — it’s purification.

{"Prompt ID": 98, "User Prompt": "What do dreams mean in spiritual context?", "Response": "Dreams can be reflections, echoes, or messages — or simply digestion of your day. Not all dreams are divine.

{"Prompt ID": 99, "User Prompt": "How do I overcome laziness?", "Response": "Start with movement — any movement. Discipline isn’t brute force, it’s love expressed consistently.

{"Prompt ID": 100, "User Prompt": "Is astrology important in the spiritual path?", "Response": "Jyotish can illuminate tendencies, timings, and karmic patterns — like a cosmic weather report.
